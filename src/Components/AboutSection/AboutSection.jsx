          Hi, I'm <strong>Mohaimenul Islam</strong>. My journey into programming
          began with curiosity and a stubborn desire to understand how things
          really work under the hood. It started during my high school days when
          I stumbled across HTML and CSS while trying to customize a blog theme.
          I had no idea back then that those small tweaks would snowball into a
          deep passion for front-end development and web technology.
